Docker Compost:
        Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
    With compose, you use a compose file and configure your application's services. Then
    using a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

List of features:
    - Multiple isolated envs on a signle host
        - Compose use a proj name to iolsate envs, you can make use of proj
          name in several different contexts:
            - On a dev host, create multiple copies of single env
            - On a CI server, to keep builds from interfering with each other
            - On a shared host, prevent projs that use same service interfering
              each other.
    - Preserve volume data when containers are created
        - Compose preservers all volumes used by your services. When
          "docker-compose up" runs, if it finds any containers from previous runs,
          it copies the volume from old container to the new one, this process ensures
          no data loses
    - Only recreate containers that have changed
        - Compose caches the configuration userd to create a container. When
          you restart a service that has not changed, compose re-uses the existing containers.
    - Variables and moving a composition between environments
        - Compose supports variables in the compose file. You can use these
          variables to customize your composition for different envs.

Using Compose is basically a three-step process:

    Define your appâ€™s environment with a Dockerfile so it can be reproduced anywhere.
    Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment.
    Lastly, run docker-compose up and Compose will start and run your entire app.
