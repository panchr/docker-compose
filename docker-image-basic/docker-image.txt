Image vs Dockerfile:
        Docker uses images to run your code, not the Dockerfile. The Dockerfile is used
    to build the image when you run docker build.

Registry vs Index:
        An index manages user accounts, permissions, search, tagging and all that nice
    stuff that's in the public web interface.
        A registry stores and serves up the actual image assets, and it delegates
    authentication to the index.
        A "docker search" searches the index, not the registry. In fact, it might be
    searching multple registries that the index is aware of.
        Once you do "docker push or pull", the index determines if you are allowed to
    access or modify the image, but the registry is the piece that stores or sends
    it down the wire.
        Beyond that, when you are working locally and running commands like "docker images",
    you are interacting with somthing that is neither an index or a registry, but a
    little of both.
        A registry holds holds a colelction of named repositories, which themselves
    are a collection of images tracked by GUIDs.

Repository:
        When you run "docker build" or "docker commit", you can speficy a name for
    the image. The name is usually in the format of "uesrname/image_name", but it
    doesn't have to be. It could be anything.

        However, when the time comes to "docker push", the index will look at the
    name, and will check to see if it has a matching repository.

    For example:
        REPOSITORY                               TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
        jwilder/docker-gen                       0.7.3               66fa1d05d9ba        10 weeks ago        19.61 MB

        In this example, we have 7 repositories.

Local Storage on the Docker Host:
        The first place to look is in /var/lib/docker/. In my case, all the images
    are stored in "/var/lib/docker/overlay"
