Service: Services are really just "containers in production". A service only runs one image,
     but it codifies the way that image runs-what ports it should use, how many
     replicas of the container should run so the service has the capacity it needs, and so on.

version:

image: Specify the image to start the container from. Can either be a repository/tag or a partial image ID.
    For example, "image: redis" or "image: ubuntu:14.04"
    If the image does not exist, compose attempts to pull it, unless you have also specified build, in which case it builds
    is using the specified options and tags it with the specified tag.

container_name: Specify a custom container name, rather than a generated default name. Because Docker container names must be
    unique, you cannot scale a service beyond 1 container if you have specified a custom name.

restart: "no" is the default restart policy, and it will not restart a container under any circumstance. When "always" is
    specified, the container alwasys restarts. The "on-failure" policy restarts a container if the exit code indicates an
    on-failure error.

ports: Expose ports. Either specify both ports (HOST:CONTAINER), or just the container port(a random host port will be chosen).
    Note: When mapping ports in the HOST:CONTAINER format, you may experience erroneous results when using a container port lower
    than 60, because YAML will parse numbers in the format xx:yy as sexagesimal(base 60). For this reason, we recommend always
    explicitly specifying your port mappings as string.

    For example:
    ports:
      - "80:80"

volumes: Mount paths or named volumes, optionally specifying a path on the host machine (HOST:CONTAINER), or an access mode
    (HOST:CONTAINER). For v2 files, named volumes need to be specified with the top-level "volumes" key.
    For example:
    volumes:
      # Just specify a path and let the Engine create a volume
      - /var/lib/mysql

      # Specify an absolute path mapping
      - /opt/data:/var/lib/mysql

      # Path on the host, relative to the Compose file
      - ./cache:/tmp/cache

      # User-relative path
      - ~/configs:/etc/configs/:ro

      # Named volume
      - datavolume:/var/lib/mysql
