Dockerfile:
    - Define what goes on in the environment inside your container. Access to
      resources like networking interfaces and disk drives is virtualized inside this env,
      which is isolated from the rest of your system, so you have to map ports to the outside
      world, and be specific about what files you want to "copy in" to that env.

FROM python:3.4-alpine
    - Build an image starting with the Python 3.4 image
